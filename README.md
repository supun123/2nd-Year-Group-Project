# 2nd-Year-Group-Project
Description

ASSET research project carried out by the SCoRe lab of UCSC focuses on exploiting a system with recent advances in flying robotic (quadcopter) and wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, which enables monitoring of the environment at low cost as an alternative strategy for electric fences and other fix detection systems. The proposed system will serve as a centralized system to store and manage data recorded from the mics as well as data related to elephant locations and assist in correlating the data gathered.

Objectives and Goals

• To provide a centralized system to store data recorded from the mics and data related to elephant locations.

• To make the registered users aware about the elephant locations

• To assist in taking actions on fence breakages by identifying them as soon as possible.

• To provide a mean of actively contributing to the course

• To provide a sound library for the researchers to analyze

Scope
The proposed system will implement a software solution to support the research project conducted by SCoRe lab of UCSC. It will also give the benefit of reducing the cost of collecting, managing and maintaining information manually since it requires lot of resources as well as time. Following is a high-level summary of system functionality.

• Storing and managing the data gathered

• Marking and viewing locations of elephants

• Marking, viewing locations of fences

• Marking fence breakages

• Alerting about elephant locations and fence breakages

• Requesting to deploy mics

• Maintaining sound library
