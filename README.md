# 2nd-Year-Group-Project

ASSET research project carried out by the SCoRe lab of UCSC focuses on exploiting a system
with recent advances in flying robotic (quadcopter) and wireless sensor network (WSN)
technology, which enables monitoring of the environment at low cost as an alternative strategy
for electric fences and other fix detection systems. The proposed system will serve as a centralized
system to store and manage data recorded from the mics as well as data related to elephant locations
and assist in correlating the data gathered.
